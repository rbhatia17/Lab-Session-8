# Fact Sheet for MSIS Program at Santa Clara University

# Claim: Santa Clara University is the number one university in Bay Area. 

# Critique of my Visualization: 
1.	The first main thing that is the claim was missing in the visualization.
2.	The images are stretched a lot.
3.	There was very little explanation to it.
4.	The visualization was trying to say the best college for bay area, which is SCU but it is not clear from this visualization.
5.	As a student when you see the visualization there are few things you would like to consider and that are:
-	Ranking of the college
-	Course curriculum
-	Comparison of the course curriculum with other colleges.
-	Where do the students get placed?
-	What’s the salary they get compared to other colleges.
-	The Faculty, who is teaching what courses what is the teacher student ratio.

# Roadmap for my Visualization:

We basically have to develop a visualization for describing and understanding our audience. And here our audience are the prospective students for Santa Clara university and the recruiters. 
So, first step is to look at the data as in our case we don’t have a lot of data so the data we have:
-	The first data we have is the ranking of colleges.
-	The second data is of the curriculum for MSIS here the curriculum for the top 2 universities.
-	The third data is for the students where they get jobs after graduating.
-	The fourth data set Is the salaries for the graduates of Santa Clara university.
-	The fifth data is the student to teacher ratio. 

Metrics are basically formed from the data we have to answer the needs and fears of our audiences. The needs here for a prospective student is the ranking of the college, curriculum and the fears is the job placement and the salaries. 

The five metrics are:

1.	The first most important metric is the ranking of the Santa Clara university, and as we can see SCU is at number 1 in bay area, this is an important metric for prospective students as well as recruiters.  
2.	The second metric is the curriculum for the MSIS program, as a prospective student have an interest in looking what courses are being offered to them and recruiters like to see it so they can get idea what are the students good at. Here the data are compared, and as we can see the curriculum for SCU offers both technical and business knowledge where as for the other university that is University of San Fransisco offers courses for business side and hardly any technical course. 
3.	The third metric is the companies where the graduates of MSIS work.
4.	The fourth is the salaries they get once they graduate and how it tends to increase over years, it’s important for the prospective as well as recruiters. 
5.	The fifth metric is the teacher to student ratio which is not a very important metric to the audience.
